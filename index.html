    <h1>Privacy Notice for Research on AI Use in FE Colleges</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy notice explains how the Gatsby Foundation collects, uses, and
      protects personal data during its research on AI use in Further Education
      colleges. The research examines how students interact with AI in their
      studies and daily lives and explores their perceptions of its impact on
      future careers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data collected in this research is processed and stored by Founders &
      Coders on behalf of Gatsby, which retains overall control of the data as
      the data controller.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Age range</strong>: Under 25 or Over 25 â€“ This helps compare
        attitudes to AI between younger and older students.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gender</strong>: Studies show gender differences in attitudes
        towards technology and careers in IT. We aim to assess whether these
        trends apply to AI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>College Name</strong>: To identify patterns across different
        institutions and educational settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subjects Being Studied</strong>: To explore whether AI usage and
        attitudes vary by subject area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI Interaction Responses</strong>: We will collect the
        text-based responses generated through an AI chat interface, which
        allows students to interact with a large language model (LLM) and
        receive generated questions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No directly identifiable personal data such as names or contact details
      will be requested. However, respondents should be aware that free-text
      responses could contain identifying information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data will be used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyse trends in AI usage and attitudes among FE students.</li>
      <li>
        Identify patterns based on age, gender, college, and subject choices.
      </li>
      <li>Generate insights to support educational policy and practice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The chatbot is deployed on Streamlit, but no data is permanently stored
      there. Collected data is securely stored in a MongoDB database, which is
      managed with appropriate security measures to protect your information. If
      there is a database server issue, transcripts and analysis can be
      temporarily stored on Streamlit until the connection is resumed and the
      data is sent to the secure database, after which the data on Streamlit is
      removed.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AI and Third-Party Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Our AI chat interface is powered by third-party providers such as OpenAI
      or Anthropic. During processing, both pre- and post-anonymisation data may
      be temporarily handled by these providers. For example, OpenAI retains
      interaction data for 30 days for abuse monitoring and does not use it for
      training unless explicitly opted in. We document this processing and have
      reviewed their data retention policies to ensure compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Anonymisation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data anonymisation</strong>: During the processing phase, any
        information that could identify individuals beyond the required
        demographic categories will be removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data retention</strong>: OpenAI retains interaction data (before
        and after anonymisation) for 30 days for abuse monitoring but does not
        use it for model training unless explicitly opted in. No personal data
        will be knowingly stored for the purpose of this research.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete anonymisation may not be fully achievable due to our limited
        control over external AI processing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Risk Management and Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      A Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) will be maintained dynamically as
      responses are collected to track and mitigate any risks of identifiable
      data being inadvertently disclosed. Participants should be aware that
      free-text responses could potentially contain self-identifying details,
      which will be removed where feasible.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Our legal basis under UK GDPR is primarily legitimate interest, supported
      by a completed Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to assess risks
      and ensure appropriate safeguards. We also adhere to data sharing best
      practices, including potential agreements with participating colleges and
      third-party processors.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download a copy of your transcript and associated analysis when it is
        being processed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Request correction or deletion, only during the same session when it is
        being processed.
      </li>
      <li>Object to processing under certain circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we are not able to handle requests for data and deletion
      after the session is complete and the anonymised data processed and
      stored. After this stage, it is no longer identifiable as being connected
      to a specific individual and therefore such requests are not possible as
      it ceases to be personal data.
    </p>
